Now I will log out as the administrator and log in as John Doe to see open tickets assigned to him.  John sees the trouble ticket and is able to resolve the issue by updating the permissions for the user.  John replies to the ticket and closes it as resolved.

Now I will log in as Jane Doe and view her open tickets.  She is able to reset a password and resolve a ticket.  She responds to a user that she needs to further investigate the issue with the monitor and leave the ticket open.
